#' Simulated genotype scores of 26 SNPs in the IL2RA gene for 100,000 individuals from the same population (CEU) ' ' This dataset was 
#' simulated using hapgen2 (http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/hapgen/hapgen2.html) and the 1000 Genomes CEU, version 3 
#' reference panel data (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/). Code details ' are provided in the MFMextra vignette. 
#' This data is an example of input to the MFMextra functions phen.gen.fn and phen.gen.t2null.fn, which simulate two diseases with a shared 
#' set of controls; phen.gen.t2null.fn simulates no associations with disease 2.
#' @format A matrix with 26 rows (SNPs) and 100,000 columns (individuals).
