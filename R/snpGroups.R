#' A list of 10 SNP groups in the IL2RA gene.
#'
#' Groups A-F were identified in the fine-mapping of multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 
# diabetes (T1D) in a large international sample (https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005272). These 
# groups have the majority of the association signals with autoimmune diseases, together with previously identified lead SNPs for other autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD; rs706799), 
# alopecia areata (AA; rs3118470), rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs10795791), and ulcerative colitis (UC; rs4147359)) will compose models that 
# contribute to the non-negligible posterior probabilities. Therefore, for computational efficiency, we extract these SNPs from the 
# generated data and focus on these in the fine-mapping simulation analysis.
